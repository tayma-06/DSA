# Data Structures

This directory contains implementations of essential data structures used in computer science and programming.  
Each structure is designed to demonstrate how data can be efficiently organized, stored, and manipulated for various computational tasks.

## Topics Covered
- Arrays and Strings  
- Linked Lists  
- Stacks and Queues  
- Trees and Binary Search Trees  
- Heaps and Priority Queues  
- Hash Tables  
- Graphs  
- Advanced Structures (Tries, Segment Trees, etc.)

## Purpose
To build a strong understanding of the internal workings of data structures and how they influence algorithm performance.  
Each implementation focuses on clarity, reusability, and conceptual depth.
