# Queue using Stack

Implement a Queue using only Stack data structures.

The Queue must support the following operations:

1. enqueue(x): Insert an element x at the rear of the queue.  
2. dequeue(): Remove the element from the front of the queue.  
3. front(): Return the front element if the queue is not empty, else return -1.  
4. size(): Return the number of elements currently in the queue.

There will be a sequence of queries queries[][]. The queries are represented in numeric form:

1 x : Call enqueue(x)  
2: Call dequeue()  
3: Call front()  
4: Call size()

You just have to implement the functions enqueue, dequeue, front and size.  
The driver code will handle the input and output.

### Constraints
- 1 ≤ number of query ≤ 10³  
- 0 ≤ x ≤ 10⁵
