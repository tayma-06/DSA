# The Celebrity Problem

A celebrity is a person who is known to all but does not know anyone at a party.  
A party is being organized by some people. A square matrix `mat[][]` of size `n * n` is used to represent people at the party such that if an element of row `i` and column `j` is set to `1`, it means the `i-th` person knows the `j-th` person.  

You need to return the index of the celebrity in the party.  
If the celebrity does not exist, return `-1`.

**Note:** Follow 0-based indexing.

### Constraints
- `1 ≤ mat.size() ≤ 1000`  
- `0 ≤ mat[i][j] ≤ 1`  
- `mat[i][i] = 1`
